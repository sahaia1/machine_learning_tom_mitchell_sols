## Chapter 1 - Machine learning 

### exercises

#### 1.1 
three computer applications where machine learning approaches make sense
1. word prediction - based on the user, the machine can learn which word is the most likely word being typed or the which word should be the next word
2. battery savings - based on the user, the system can analyse which programs are most likely to be used and which can be shut down thus saving battery
3. spam prediction - predicting spam emails

Three computer applications where machine learning approaches donâ€™t make sense
1. calculators
2. notepads
3. web browser

#### 1.2 
learning task - battery savings in laptops
the idea here is to determine the best way to save battery life in laptops given a particular user's usage pattern. the machine leanring algorithm can learn the behavior patter of the user and optimize each application's usage accordingly. it is often the case that users open several battery draining applications at once and forget about them. if the algorithm can predict which application is not likely to be used anymore, then it can save changes in that appliation and either close it or move it to a more silent state where it won't consume a lot of processing power.
