## Chapter 3 - Decision Tree Learning

### Notes

_What is inductive inference?_
-> any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples.

_inductive bias for decision trees_
-> preference for small trees over big trees
